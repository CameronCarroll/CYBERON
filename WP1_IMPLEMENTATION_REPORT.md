# Work Package 1: Core MCP Server Infrastructure - Implementation Report

## Overview
Work Package 1 has been successfully implemented, providing the basic MCP server architecture and transport layer. This serves as the foundation for all subsequent work packages that will build on this infrastructure.

## Implemented Components

### 1. MCP Server Module Structure
- Created a modular structure for the MCP server with proper separation of concerns
- Organized into main server, transports, and handlers modules
- Set up clean interfaces between components

### 2. Server Initialization Logic
- Implemented `MCPServer` class with proper initialization
- Set up capability declaration and negotiation
- Created request handling framework
- Implemented JSON-RPC 2.0 message processing

### 3. STDIO Transport Layer
- Implemented a transport base class defining the interface
- Created a STDIO transport for local process communication
- Added proper thread management for reading from stdin
- Implemented proper message passing

### 4. Protocol Version Negotiation
- Added protocol version declaration (0.5.0)
- Implemented basic version negotiation in the initialization handler
- Set up capability declaration structure

### 5. Capability Declaration
- Added capability reporting in the server info
- Implemented capability declaration endpoint
- Set up structure for future capabilities (resources, tools, prompts)

## Testing
Comprehensive test suite was created to verify the implementation:
- Server initialization tests
- Handler registration and execution tests
- Error handling tests
- Transport tests
- Request processing tests

## Usage
The MCP server can be started using:
```bash
python mcp_server.py [--debug] [--transport {stdio}]
```

## Next Steps
Work Package 2 will focus on integrating the MCP server with the CYBERON query engine to provide actual data access and functionality.
