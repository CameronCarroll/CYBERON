# Work Package 2: Query Engine Integration - Implementation Report

## Overview

Work Package 2 focused on integrating the CyberneticsQueryEngine with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This integration allows MCP clients to interact with the CYBERON ontology database through the protocol's standardized messaging format.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Query Engine Adapter

A Query Engine adapter module was created (`app/mcp/handlers/query.py`) that acts as a bridge between the MCP protocol and the CyberneticsQueryEngine. This adapter:

- Maintains a reference to the global query engine instance
- Implements session management for MCP connections
- Provides handler functions for different query operations
- Handles error cases and returns appropriate responses

The adapter exposes the following MCP methods:

- `cyberon/search`: Search for entities by name or keyword
- `cyberon/entity`: Get detailed information about a specific entity
- `cyberon/paths`: Find paths between two entities
- `cyberon/connections`: Find entities connected to a specific entity

### 2. Session Management

The implementation includes a session management system that tracks information for each transport connection. Sessions store:

- Recent searches
- Recently accessed entities
- Recently queried paths

This provides context-aware functionality and allows for future enhancements like personalized recommendations or query history.

### 3. Server Integration

The MCPServer class was updated to:

- Accept and store a reference to the query engine
- Register query engine handlers
- Support providing query engine functionality through MCP methods
- Update server capabilities to indicate tool support

### 4. Application Integration

The Flask application was enhanced to:

- Initialize the MCP server alongside the web API
- Share the query engine instance between both interfaces
- Manage MCP server lifecycle (startup/shutdown)
- Handle error conditions gracefully

### 5. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling was implemented to ensure robustness:

- Detection of missing query engine
- Validation of required parameters
- Graceful handling of exceptions from the query engine
- Appropriate error messages in JSON-RPC format

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite was created to verify the integration:

- Unit tests for all handler functions
- Tests for session management
- Tests for error handling
- Tests for JSON-RPC message format compliance

The tests use mock query engine objects to verify behavior without requiring a real database.

## Capabilities

The server now exposes tools capability in its capabilities declaration:

```json
{
  "supports": {
    "resources": false,  
    "tools": true,       
    "prompts": false     
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

While the core integration is complete, several enhancements could be considered for future work:

1. More sophisticated session management with persistence
2. Additional query operations from the query engine
3. Performance optimizations for large ontologies
4. Support for real-time updates when the ontology changes

## Conclusion

Work Package 2 successfully bridges the CYBERON query engine with the MCP protocol, allowing MCP clients to explore and analyze the cybernetics ontology. This implementation provides a solid foundation for the resource and tool implementations planned in subsequent work packages.
